Currently, I am an MBA student at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business.
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Finance and Marketing from Washington University in St. Louis (2018). 

I previously worked at Nielsen BASES as a market research analyst.
In a quick turn of events, I was inspired to pursue an MBA at Tepper to become a leader of technological change in industry.

Seeking a technical and theoretical understanding of cutting edge analytical techniques, I engaged in independent study with Professor DK.
I quickly fell in love with the pursuit of knowledge creation and extraction from Big Data and deepening our understanding of the world.
In another turn of events, I was inspired to pursue a PhD.

Through research with DK, I grew fascinated by topics that involve human-AI collaboration, specifically leveraging AI as intellectual partners and human-AI creativity.
Additionally, I'm interested in how the rise of ubiquitous computing will define the future of the human experience, especially with regards to ethics, human-machine symbiosis, and information democracy.

Outside of the classroom, I am an active member of the dance community, both at WashU and Carnegie Mellon, where I've taught workshops and led performance groups.
