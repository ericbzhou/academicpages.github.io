Currently, I am an MBA student at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business.
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Finance and Marketing from Washington University in St. Louis (2018). 

I previously worked at Nielsen BASES as a market research analyst.
In a quick turn of events, I was inspired to pursue an MBA at Tepper to become a leader of technological change in industry.

Seeking a technical and theoretical understanding of cutting edge anaytical techniques, I engaged in independent study with Professor DK.
I quickly fell in love with the pursuit of knowledge creation and extraction from Big Data.

I grew fascinated by topics that involve human-AI collaboration, especially with regards to leveraging AI as intellectual partners and human-AI creativity.
Likewise, I'm interested in how the rise of ubiquitous computing will define the future of the human experience, especially with regards to ethics, human-machine symbiosis, and information democracy.

*I love hip hop/urban dance, but made my start in the hobby with K-Pop dance at WashU.
