I am a second year MBA student in Business Analytics with concentrations in Business Technology and Operations Research at the Tepper School of Business of Carnegie Mellon University. I am advised by Professor [Dokyun Lee](https://www.leedokyun.com/).

I will be applying to PhD programs in Quantitative Marketing and Information Systems for Fall 2021 entry.

Prior to Tepper, I graduated from Washington University in St. Louis with degrees in Finance and Marketing in 2018. Post-graduation, I worked as an analyst at a large market research firm where I consulted for CPG clients seeking to innovate on their products.

I am a self-learned Machine Learning and Deep Learning practitioner. A future goal of mine is to make Machine Learning accessible to students and professionals from all backgrounds. With a deeper pool of collective intelligence in the field, I believe we can improve the overall human experience.

My Research Interests
------
**Methodologically**, I am interested in developing human-computer collaboration paradigms and new technology to gracefully integrate human-machine workflows in managerial and social settings.

**Substantively**, I seek to apply human-computer interaction systems to solve provocative problems in ethics, human-machine symbiosis, and information democracy to reach better social and managerial outcomes.


Current Projects
------
1. *Hypothesis Development with Unstructured Data Via Interpretable Machine Learning*. <br/>
Dokyun Lee, **Eric Zhou**, Chengfeng Mao. Accepted to MISQ Author Workshop 2020. Work in progress. <br/>
>*"Recent advances in Interpretable Machine Learning (IML) offer potential flexible, scalable solutions to augment novel hypothesis development, especially with exponential growth in unstructured data. We demonstrate by applying a novel IML algorithm on three datasets to reproduce theory-driven insights from literature."*
