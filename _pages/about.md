I am a second year MBA candidate studying Business Analytics with concentrations in Business Technology and Operations Research at the [Tepper School of Business](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/index.html) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am advised by Professor [Dokyun Lee](https://www.leedokyun.com/).

I am applying to Ph.D. programs for Fall 2021 entry.

Prior to Tepper, I graduated from [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/) with degrees in Finance and Marketing from the [Olin Business School](https://olin.wustl.edu/EN-US/Pages/default.aspx) in 2018. Post-graduation, I worked as an analyst at a large market research firm where I consulted for CPG clients seeking to innovate on their products.

I am a self-learned Machine Learning and Deep Learning practitioner. A future goal of mine is to make Machine Learning accessible to students and professionals from all backgrounds. With a broader pool of collective intelligence across disciplines, I believe we can improve the human experience through a deeper understanding of the world.

My Research Interests
------
**Methodologically**, I am interested in developing human-computer collaboration paradigms and new technology to ethically and sustainably integrate human and AI intelligence to improve managerial decision making and policy design.

**Substantively**, my interests lie at the intersection of the social, behavioral, and technical aspects of AI. I am broadly interested in the interaction between technology and human decisions and behaviors.
Specific applications include AI-driven product ideation and AI-mediated interaction in the mobile economy and social media.

**Philosophically**, I believe that a human-centric approach to operationalizing pervasive, intimate systems can transform social and economic interactions to increase welfare.

Current Projects
------
1. Dokyun Lee, **Eric Zhou**, Chengfeng Mao, Gerald Kane. *Interpretable Machine Learning For Theory Building: Human-AI Collaboration*. <br/>
Accepted to MISQ Author Workshop. *Work in progress.* <br/>
>*"Recent advances in Interpretable Machine Learning (IML) offer potential flexible, scalable solutions to help humans develop novel hypotheses, especially with exponential growth in unstructured data. We demonstrate by applying a novel IML algorithm on three datasets to reproduce theory-driven insights from literature."*
